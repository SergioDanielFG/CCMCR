\title{Simulated Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Data}
\format{
A data frame with 150 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
\item{Batch}{Batch identifier (factor)}
\item{Fase}{Phase indicator: "Fase 1" or "Fase 2" (factor)}
\item{Status}{Batch status: "Under Control" or "Out of Control" (factor)}
\item{Concentration}{Concentration of active ingredient (mg/mL)}
\item{Humidity}{Humidity percentage (\% w/w)}
\item{Dissolution}{Dissolution percentage (\% released)}
\item{Density}{Density (g/cm\eqn{^3})}
}
}
\source{
Simulated using \code{\link{simulate_pharma_batches}} with seed = 308.
}
\usage{
data("datos_farma")
}
\description{
This dataset contains simulated pharmaceutical manufacturing data generated by the
\code{simulate_pharma_batches()} function.
}
\details{
Phase 1 includes 10 under-control batches with natural variability in mean and covariance
but without contamination.

Phase 2 includes 2 additional under-control batches and 3 out-of-control batches.
The out-of-control batches exhibit shifts in both mean and variability,
along with moderate contamination in a portion of their observations.

Each batch contains 10 observations measured across
four quantitative quality control variables.
