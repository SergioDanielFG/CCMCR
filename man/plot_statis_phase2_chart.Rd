\title{Plot STATIS Dual Robust Control Chart - Phase 2 (All Batches)}
\usage{
plot_statis_phase2_chart(phase1_result, phase2_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{phase1_result}{A list returned by \code{robust_statis_phase1()}, which includes
\code{batch_statistics} with Chi-squared values for Phase 1 batches.}

\item{phase2_result}{A list returned by \code{robust_statis_phase2()}, including
\code{chi_stats_by_batch} with aggregated Mahalanobis distances and a control \code{threshold}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing the control chart, where each point corresponds to
a batch and its summed Mahalanobis distance; includes a control threshold line.
}
\description{
Plots the Chi-squared statistics for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 batches,
using the \strong{sum of robust Mahalanobis distances per batch}.
Batches from Phase 1 are considered "under control", and batches from Phase 2
are typically "out of control" candidates.
