Description:Implements a robust multivariate control chart methodology based on
    the STATIS Dual approach to monitor batch-based industrial processes with
    multiple correlated variables. A robust compromise covariance matrix is
    constructed using Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimators from Phase I
    batches, and a robust Hotelling-type T2 statistic is used for anomaly detection.
    Phase II batches are evaluated via standardized Mahalanobis distances projected
    onto the compromise structure. The package includes functions for simulating
    contaminated and clean batches, applying robust and classical Hotelling T2 control
    charts, and visualizing results through robust biplots (GH-biplot and projection)
    and an interactive Shiny dashboard. An internal dataset ('datos_farma') is provided
    for reproducibility.
