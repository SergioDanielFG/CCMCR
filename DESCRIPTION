Description:CCMCR implements a robust multivariate control chart designed to monitor processes with multiple interrelated quantitative variables. The methodology is based on a robust adaptation of the STATIS Dual approach, which constructs a compromise covariance matrix from batch-level robust estimators. For each batch, a robust Hotelling T² statistic is computed using the global robust center and the compromise matrix, and compared to a chi-square threshold to detect out-of-control behavior. The package includes functions for batch data simulation, robust standardization, control chart visualization, GH-biplot representation, and an interactive Shiny dashboard.
