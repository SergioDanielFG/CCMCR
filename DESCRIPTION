Description:Description: CCMCR implements a robust multivariate control chart methodology based on the STATIS Dual approach, designed to monitor batch-based industrial processes involving multiple correlated quantitative variables. The method constructs a robust compromise covariance matrix using Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimators from Phase 1 batches, and calculates a robust Hotelling-type T² statistic for anomaly detection. Phase 2 batches are evaluated using standardized Mahalanobis distances projected onto the compromise structure. The package includes tools for simulating contaminated and clean batches, applying robust and classical Hotelling T² control charts, and visualizing results via robust biplots (GH-biplot and projection) and an interactive Shiny dashboard. Also includes an internal dataset (datos_farma) for reproducibility and demonstration.
